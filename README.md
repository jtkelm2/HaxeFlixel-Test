# Calculation Solitaire

My first test project in HaxeFlixel, this is a barebones implementation of the game of Calculation (a simple but challenging solitaire variant). Go to `http://jtkelm2.github.io/HaxeFlixel-Test/` to play!

Made possible with a Github workflow provided by `https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/game-jam-template`. Card sprites courtesy of `https://drawsgood.itch.io/8bit-deck-card-assets`.
